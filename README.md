# Overview

This program was written to explore how to build data structures to effectively store information.

The software includes 5 commands: input, print, save, load, and clear. combined, they allow a user to effectively build a table of items, save, and print it in a readable format.

I wrote this in order to dive back into C++, which I had not written anything in for a while as well as deepen my understanding of its available libraries.

# Future Work

Things to improve/add

- Scrubbing user input
- Error handling
- alter read/write format to something more universal, such as .json
- make table view mroe dynamic for larger description sizes (array of chars divided by character width?)
